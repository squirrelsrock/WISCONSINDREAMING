	<p>ooOoOOoooO! Let me tell you the tale of me! I was wondering on a website when I clicked on a page that was in <i>development</i>! I decided to click it and ended up on a weird black page with a ghost telling me to get off of the website! I didnt listen and stuck around! The ghost was right! I ended up dying or something, and now I haunt this undeveloped webpage! Haunting souls who DARE cross my webpage! YOU MUST LEAVE MY WEB PAGE, AT ONCE! NOWWWW!</p>
